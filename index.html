                <span>&#8226;</span> In this experiment, we are going to test Bubble Cursor.<br>
                <span>&#8226;</span> There are two types of cursor in this experiment: Bubble and Normal.<br>
                <span>&#8226;</span> There are 4 blocks, 2 blocks for each type.<br>
                <span>&#8226;</span> Each block has 27 trials.<br>
                <span>&#8226;</span> Each trial has 9 targets in sequence (not counting the initial click).<br>
                <span>&#8226;</span> A break will be held every two blocks.<br>
                <span>&#8226;</span> Click on the red target at the start of each trial to begin.<br>
                <span>&#8226;</span> Then move your mouse to select green circle. <br>
                <span>&#8226;</span> Do it until the experiment finishes.<br>
                <span>&#8226;</span> Try to select the green circles as quickly as possible.<br>
                <span>&#8226;</span> It should take less than 30 minutes.<br>
                <span>&#8226;</span> You can start the experiment by clicking on the below button.<br>
